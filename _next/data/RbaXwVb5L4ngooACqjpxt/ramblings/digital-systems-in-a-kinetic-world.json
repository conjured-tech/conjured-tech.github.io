Don't pretend like we can just ignore tech, ignore modern innovation, and that somehow that will let us win.\r\n\r\nIn fact, it's precisely ***because*** we've been so complacent and downright lazy with our knowledge, our implementation, our attention and our effort on tech that we're in this bind.\r\n\r\nWe always knew the powers that be would use tech for their benefit and for society's detriment. We always knew this, it's happened so many times in history.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, we did nothing to secure a future for ourselves where the people were in control of the tech, rather than the tech being in control of them.\r\n\r\nIt's time to take the power back.

Become the type of person that can use the tool, rather than be used by it.","ogImage":{"url":"../public/images/homeserver.jpg"},"coverImage":""}},"__N_SSG":true}
