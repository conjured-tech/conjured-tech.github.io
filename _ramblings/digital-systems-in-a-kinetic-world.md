Holy smokes people we gotta stop sticking our heads in the sand.

Acting like "we'll just go off grid" is an actual answer to the threats that await and *currently* face us.

Self reliance and self-resilience dictate ***using*** technology to our actual advantage. Don't pretend like we can just ignore tech, ignore modern innovation, and that somehow that will let us win.

In fact, it's precisely ***because*** we've been so complacent and downright lazy with our knowledge, our implementation, our attention and our effort on tech that we're in this bind.

We always knew the powers that be would use tech for their benefit and for society's detriment. We always knew this, it's happened so many times in history.

And yet, we did nothing to secure a future for ourselves where the people were in control of the tech, rather than the tech being in control of them.

It's time to take the power back. Quit using 'devices' - start using tools. Become the type of person that can use the tool, rather than be used by it.
